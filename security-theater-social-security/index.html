<p>So recently I've been going through the experience of what it's like to change your name with the United States government. I sorta went into this thinking it was going to be relatively painless, I mean traditonally at least one person in a married relationship augments their name in order to add their signficant others. Oh boy, was I wrong.</p>
<p>If you haven't had the pleaseure of getting your name changed, one of the first things you're going to need to is change your Social Security Card, at least in the United States. For those of you reading not from the good ol' U.S. of A, a Social Security card is one mechanism that the government uses as a form of identification. Specfically, it's used to track that you're paying your taxes, and once you reach retirement age you can use that to cash in on your Social Security benefits. But, since it's such a "permament" form of identification, it also get's used to track your credit history to see if a bank should give you a loan, and therefore also get's used by credit card companies when you apply for a credit card.</p>
<p>For those who are security inclined reading this, you're probably thinking to yourself, hmm.. doesn't that make a Social Security number a sort of "god key" to basically steal anyone's identity. <strong>Correct</strong>. Given anyone's social security card, which includes both their number and name, you could open basically any credit card in their name, and charge tons of purchases to this card.</p>
<p>So, if you want to go and have your name changed on your Social Security Card, it's relatiely easy actually. You have to go into your local Social Security Adminsitration office, bring or fill out a replacement card form, take a number and wait until you're called. Then you hand them the form, show other forms of identitifaction (i.e. Drivers License, Birth Cretificate) and then wait 2-4 weeks until your new card arrives in the mail.</p>
<p>Having done all of the above, I waited my 2-4 weeks, and my card never arrived. Then I thought to myself, "I'll just wait another week or so, I'm sure it's just typical U.S. government, eveything is slow." So I waited an additional two weeks, and nothing showed up. So having looked on the Social Security Administration website how to check up on the status of an application, I called their 1-800 number. But, as it turns out the website is wrong, and actually you have to call into your local office where you submitted the application.</p>
<p>So sure enough I did just that, and asked about the status of my application, and was meet with an awkward "We already sent it out, weeks ago in fact." And, this is where my frustration in this process actually starts.</p>
<p>The office claimed they sent out my social security card, but had no way to track the mail, so had no idea where it actually is. Most likely it just bounced back to their office, but they don't check to see if mail does bounce back. Or in other words, at worst, the mail had gotten stolen at some point, and now somoene out there just has my social security number.</p>
<p>Now, in order to remedy the fact that I don't have a valid social security number, I now have to go back into the Social Security office, fill back out the exact same form, and submit it all over again. This isn't the worse thing in the world, but it is quite inconvient</p>
<p>Surely I thought, as I talked with the person from the Social Security office, there must be something I can do, given that it's entierly possible someone has just stolen my identity. And I was meet with an extremly frustrating, "No."</p>
<p>Since, I can't actually prove that there has been any abuse use my social security number, I can't actually apply to have my number changed. That's right, there's no proactive way for you to keep yourself secure in this system. There is no "second factor" that ensures it's you using the number, so you're basically just playing a waiting game.</p>
<p>Now, there are ways to put checks on your credit history so that if a credit card get's opened in your name, you get alerted, and then can call the credit card company to have it cancelled. But, generally these services aren't perfect, and who could actually expect them to be, when there is so much rampart fraud, and clearly it's extremly easy to just steal someone's social security number from the mail.</p>
<p>I will 100% admit here, that I am not a security expert. My background is mostly in Web Development, and I've been known to expand to full-stack as needed. But, I know without a doubt, that having one "god key" into any system is a HUGE security hole, just waiting to happen.</p>
<p>If this was any modern software company, holding personal data, it would make the front page of every tech blog, with a title to the effect of, "Tech Giant just leaked millions of users passwords, that we're stored in plain text." But, for some reason, when it's a government we just shrug this off, and say "eh, it's old crusty low tech government."</p>
<p>What's even better, is that my story is a mild form of stories that happen to millions of people everyday. Credit card theft and identity fraud is so prevalent that <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/how-credit-card-companies-spot-fraud-before-you-do" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">credit card companies will actually detect</a> and cover the charges, just as a means of preventing you from canceling your card.</p>
<p>But now, my personal "god key" could now be there out there, and I could have no idea. I've already put up credit alerts, and I just hope that, that's enough. Now, I just sit here, waiting and hoping that some piece of mail bounced back to an office, and was shred by some office worker.</p>
<p>The idea that we let our government run on a single factor authentication system, but demand better from tech companies, is ludacris to me. A secondary factor, has to be implemented at some point, and I hope soon. I'll be the first in line to fill out whatever form, that I'm sure will come along with it.</p>
<p>I look forward to calling my local social security office again in a week's time, to check in on the status of my new application. Hopefully, the mail actually shows up.</p>
